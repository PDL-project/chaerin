# For the task of putting the apple in the fridge and switching off the light, we need to allocate robots based on their skills and mass capacity. 

# SubTask 1: Put Apple in Fridge
# Skills Required: GoToObject, PickupObject, PutObject
# Robot 1 has all the required skills for this subtask. 
# Robot 1 can perform this subtask alone.

# SubTask 2: Switch Off the Light
# Skills Required: GoToObject, SwitchOff
# Robot 2 has all the required skills for this subtask.
# Robot 2 can perform this subtask alone.

# Task Allocation:
# - SubTask 1 (Put Apple in Fridge): Assign to Robot 1
# - SubTask 2 (Switch Off the Light): Assign to Robot 2

# Both subtasks can be performed in parallel as they do not depend on each other. 
# Allocate Robot 1 to SubTask 1 and Robot 2 to SubTask 2 for efficient completion of the overall task.
