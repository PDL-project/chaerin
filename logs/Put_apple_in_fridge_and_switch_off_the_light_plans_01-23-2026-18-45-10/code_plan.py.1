#To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of switching off a light, we need to follow these steps:

#Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

#Objects Involved:

    Robots: robot2
    object: LightSwitch
    Inital location of LightSwitch

#Initial States:

    at-location LightSwitch counterTop
    switch-on robot2 LightSwitch
    inaction robot2

#Step 2: Define Goals

Goals:

    switch-off LightSwitch

pddl

(define (problem switch_off_light_problem)
  (:domain robot2)
  (:objects
    robot2 - robot
    LightSwitch - object
    counterTop - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot2 counterTop)
    (at-location LightSwitch counterTop)
    (switch-on robot2 LightSwitch)
    (inaction robot2)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (switch-off LightSwitch)
    )
  )
)

#Problem file generation is done.
