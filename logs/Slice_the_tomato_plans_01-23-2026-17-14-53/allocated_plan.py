Based on the provided task decomposition for "Slice the Tomato" and the available robots and objects, I will assign the task to the robots.

**Task Assignment:**

1. **GoToObject**: This subtask requires a robot with the `GoToObject` skill. All three robots have this skill.
2. **PickupObject**: This subtask requires a robot with the `PickupObject` skill. All three robots have this skill.
3. **SliceObject**: This subtask requires a robot with the `SliceObject` skill. Only Robot 1 has this skill.

**Task Allocation:**

* **Robot 1:** Perform all three subtasks (GoToObject, PickupObject, and SliceObject) since it has the necessary skills.
* **Robot 2 and Robot 3:** Not required for this task as they do not have the `SliceObject` skill.

**Mass Capacity:**

All three robots have a mass capacity of 100 units, which is sufficient to handle the objects involved in the task (Apple, Bowl, Bread, ButterKnife, etc.).

**Availability:**

Assuming all three robots are available for the task, Robot 1 will be assigned to perform the subtasks.

This assignment ensures that the task "Slice the Tomato" is completed with the necessary skills and mass capacity.
