Based on the task decomposition for "Slice the tomato", we can assign the following subtasks to each robot:

1. **Go to the tomato**: Robot 1 is assigned this task since it has the necessary skills.
2. **Pick up the knife**: Robot 2 is assigned this task since it has the necessary skills and is available.
3. **Go to the tomato (again)**: Since both robots have completed their previous tasks, we can assign this subtask to either robot. Let's assign it to Robot 1.
4. **Slice the tomato**: Both robots have the necessary skills for this task, but since Robot 2 has already picked up the knife, we can assign this task to Robot 2.

The final assignment is:

* Robot 1: Go to the tomato, Go to the tomato (again)
* Robot 2: Pick up the knife, Slice the tomato

This assignment ensures that each robot has the necessary skills for its assigned tasks and that the tasks are performed in a logical order.
