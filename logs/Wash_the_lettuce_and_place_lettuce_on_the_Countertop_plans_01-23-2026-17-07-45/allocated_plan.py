Based on the provided task descriptions and robot capabilities, I will assign tasks to each robot.

**Task 1: Wash the lettuce**

* Robot 2 has the necessary skills (`GoToObject`, `PickupObject`) to pick up the lettuce.
* Robot 3 has the necessary skills (`SwitchOn`, `SwitchOff`) to turn on/off the water faucet and clean the lettuce.
* However, Robot 2 is assigned this task as it has the required skills.

**Task 2: Place the cleaned lettuce on the Countertop**

* Robot 2 has the necessary skills (`GoToObject`, `PutObject`) to place the cleaned lettuce on the Countertop.

**Task 3: Clean the Coffee Machine**

* Robot 1 has the necessary skills (`BreakObject`, `SwitchOn`, `SwitchOff`) to clean the Coffee Machine.
* Robot 1 is assigned this task as it has the required skills.

**Task 4: Place the cleaned Coffee Machine on the Countertop**

* Robot 3 has the necessary skills (`GoToObject`, `PutObject`) to place the cleaned Coffee Machine on the Countertop.

The tasks are assigned based on the available robots' capabilities. The mass capacity of each robot is not a limiting factor in this scenario, as all objects have masses below their respective capacities.

Here's a summary of the task assignments:

| Task | Robot |
| --- | --- |
| Wash the lettuce | Robot 2 |
| Place the cleaned lettuce on the Countertop | Robot 2 |
| Clean the Coffee Machine | Robot 1 |
| Place the cleaned Coffee Machine on the Countertop | Robot 3 |
