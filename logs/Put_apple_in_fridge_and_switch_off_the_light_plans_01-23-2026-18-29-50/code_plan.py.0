Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

Objects Involved:

    Robots: robot1
    object: apple
    object: fridge
    initial location of apple, fridge

Initial States:

    at-location apple counterTop
    at-location fridge kitchenArea
    at robot1 diningTable
    (robot1 is not inaction)

Step 2: Define Goals

Goals:

    at-location apple fridge

Problem file generation:

```pddl
(define (problem put_apple_in_fridge_problem)
  (:domain robot1)
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    apple - object
    fridge - object
    counterTop - object
    kitchenArea - object
    diningTable - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot1 diningTable)
    (at-location apple counterTop)
    (at-location fridge kitchenArea)
    (not (inaction robot1))
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (at-location apple fridge)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done
