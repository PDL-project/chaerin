To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of switching off a light, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

Objects Involved:
- Robots: robot2
- Object: LightSwitch
- Initial location of LightSwitch

Initial States:
- at-location LightSwitch CounterTop
- inaction robot2

Step 2: Define Goals

Goals:
- switch-off robot2 LightSwitch

PDDL Problem File:

```pddl
(define (problem switch_off_light_problem)
  (:domain robot2)
  (:objects
    robot2 - robot
    LightSwitch - object
    CounterTop - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot2 CounterTop)
    (at-location LightSwitch CounterTop)
    (inaction robot2)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (switch-off robot2 LightSwitch)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
